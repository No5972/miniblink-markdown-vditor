# Miniblink Markdown Vditor

**Vditor desktop app wrapper in Miniblink**

We want a lightweight desktop markdown editor. But nearly all the installation packages are of over 50 megabytes. We decided to build our own markdown editor, which adopts this lightweight render engine of [Miniblink](https://github.com/weolar/miniblink49/). 

This app also adopted this editor engine of [Vditor](https://github.com/Vanessa219/vditor), which can make us conveniently build markdown editors in pure JavaScript.

The compressed archive of this version is of only 20 megabytes. The folder decompressed is of 53 megabytes.
